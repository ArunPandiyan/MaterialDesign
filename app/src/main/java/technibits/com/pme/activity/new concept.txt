image management lib
Fresco's image pipeline will load images from the network, local storage, or local resources.
To save data and CPU, it has three levels of cache; two in memory and another in internal storage.

Fresco's Drawees show a placeholder for you until the image has loaded and automatically show to the image when it arrives.
 When the image goes off-screen, it automatically releases its memory.
